# Global Population Analysis

This repository contains an R script for analyzing global population data. The script performs various data cleaning, visualization, and mapping tasks using different R libraries.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the necessary R packages installed. You can install them using the `install.packages()` function if they are not already available.

The script uses the following R libraries:
- `readr`
- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `gridExtra`
- `maptools`
- `RColorBrewer`
- `tidyverse`
- `gpclib` (additional installation required)

To install the necessary packages, run the following commands in your R environment:

```R
install.packages(c("readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "maptools", "RColorBrewer", "tidyverse"))
install.packages("gpclib")
Once the packages are installed, you need to permit the use of gpclib:

R
Copy code
library(gpclib)
gpclibPermit()
Script Overview
The script performs the following steps:

Load Libraries: Import required libraries.
Read Data: Load global population data from global_population.csv.
Data Cleaning: Clean and transform population and percentage columns.
Visualization:
Create boxplots and bar charts of the top 10 most populous countries.
Customize and refine plots for better visualization.
Plot global population data on a world map with color coding.
Mapping:
Plot a world map highlighting top 14 countries by population.
Data File
Ensure that the global_population.csv file is present in the same directory as the script. This file should contain global population data with columns for country, population, and percentage.

Usage
Run the script in your R environment. The script will produce various plots and maps, including:

Boxplots and bar charts of top 10 countries by population.
A world map colored according to the population of the top 14 countries.
To execute the script, simply run the following command in your R console:
